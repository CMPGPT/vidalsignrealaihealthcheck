Document Type: Medical Lab Report (flabs)
Patient Information: Mr. Ayush, 23 Years/Male
Test Date: 03/05/2024
Report ID: RE378

Test Results:
- HbA1C: 5% (Reference Range: 4.0 - 6.0%)
- Estimated Average Glucose: 96.80 mg/dL (Reference Range: 90 - 120 mg/dL)

Analysis:
The HbA1C result of 5% falls within the normal range (4.0-6.0%), indicating good blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. The estimated average glucose of 96.80 mg/dL is also within normal limits (90-120 mg/dL).

Clinical Interpretation:
- HbA1C of 5% indicates normal glycemic control
- This level suggests a low risk of diabetes
- The estimated average glucose supports this interpretation

Recommendations:
1. Continue current lifestyle habits as they appear to be maintaining good blood sugar control
2. Regular monitoring may be beneficial for ongoing health maintenance
3. Consider annual HbA1C testing for preventive care

Please consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.`;
